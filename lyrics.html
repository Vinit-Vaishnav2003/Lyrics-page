  Kiss me hard before you go
  Summertime sadness
  I just wanted you to know
  That baby, you the best

  I got my red dress on tonight
  Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
  Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
  High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

  Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
  Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
  Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
  Nothin' scares me anymore
  (One, two, three, four)
        
  Kiss me hard before you go
  Summertime sadness
  I just wanted you to know
  That baby, you the best
      
  I got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
  Got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
        
  I'm feelin' electric tonight
  Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
  Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
  I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
        
  Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
  Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
  Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
  Nothin' scares me anymore
  (One, two, three, four)
        
  Kiss me hard before you go
  Summertime sadness
  I just wanted you to know
  That baby, you the best
        
  I got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
  Got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
        
  Think I'll miss you forever
  Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
  Later's better than never
  Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (drive), drive
       
  I got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
  Got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
       
  Kiss me hard before you go
  Summertime sadness
  I just wanted you to know
  That baby, you the best
       
  I got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
  Got that summertime, summertime sadness
  Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
